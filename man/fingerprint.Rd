\description{
\code{fingerprint} is an internal function that takes the "fingerprint" of a
dataframe, and currently replaces the contents (x) with the class of a
given object, unless it is missing (coded as \code{NA}), in which case it leaves
it as \code{NA}. The name "fingerprint" is taken from the csv-fingerprint, of
which the package, \code{visdat}, is based upon
