\description{
\code{fingerprint} is an internal function that takes the "fingerprint" of a
dataframe, and (currently) replaces the contents (x) with the class of a
given object, unless it is missing (coded as NA), in which case it leaves
it as NA. The name "fingerprint" is taken from the csv-fingerprint, of
which this package is based.
