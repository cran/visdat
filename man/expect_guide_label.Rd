\usage{
expect_guide_label(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is a dataframe passed from \code{vis_miss(x)}.}
}
\value{
a \code{tibble} with two columns \code{p_miss_lab} and \code{p_pres_lab},
containing the labels to use for present and missing. A dataframe is
returned because I think it is a good style habit compared to a list.
}
\description{
\code{miss_guide_label} is an internal function to label the legend of \code{vis_miss}.
